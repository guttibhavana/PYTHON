Python Environment Setup:
Using VS Code to create project folders and .py files.
Example: Folder for Jan 2023 batch; container.py.

Comments:
Explain code; ignored by Python interpreter.
Single-line: #
Multi-line: ''' ''' or """ """

Variables:
Store data values; created when assigned.
Must start with a letter or _.
Example: name = 20

Keywords:
Reserved words with special meaning; cannot be used as variable names.
Examples: def, return, if, while

Data Types:
Define the type of data stored.
Examples: int, float, bool

Type Checking:
Identify the data type using type().
Example: type(10) → <class 'int'>

Type Conversion:
Change one data type to another
Functions: int(), float(), etc.
Example: int("10") converts string to integer

Mathematical Expressions:
Perform calculations using operators.
Examples: (a + b) ** 2, +, *, **

Practical Applications:
Implement real-world programs using Python concepts.
Examples: Simple Interest, Compound Interest calculations

summary:
Python supports dynamic typing, making variable creation simple.
Proper use of comments improves readability and collaboration.
Variable naming rules prevent syntax errors.
Data types and type conversion are fundamental for calculations and logic.
Practical examples, like interest calculations, reinforce theoretical concepts.
Using VS Code shortcuts and extensions increases coding productivity.
