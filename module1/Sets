Set Data Structure:
set is an unordered, unindexed collection with no duplicate values. Compared sets to lists and emphasized their uniqueness and the fact that items cannot be accessed by index.
You can create a set using curly braces {} or the set() constructor. 
Sets support various methods and operators for modification and mathematical operations. 
modification methods:add(), update(), remove(), discard(), pop(),clear()
Basic Set maths Operations: Union, Difference, Intersection
comparision: issubset(), issuperset(),isdisjoint()

Advanced Set Operations and Concepts:
Covered symmetric difference, disjoint sets, subset and superset relations, and their practical implementations in Python.

Frozenset: Immutable Sets
Frozenset, the immutable version of the set. Explained that frozensets are hashable, can be used as dictionary keys or set elements
Frozenset is the immutable counterpart of a set; it can be used as a dictionary key or within other sets due to hashability.
