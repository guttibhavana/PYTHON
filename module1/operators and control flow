Operators:
These are foundational tools used for arithmetic, comparison, assignment, and logical operations in programming.
Key operator categories introduced:
.Arithmetic Operators: for mathematical calculations (	+, -, *, /, %, //, **)
.Relational Operators: to compare values (	<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=).
.Assignment Operators: to assign values to variables(=, +=, -=, *=).
.Logical Operators: such as and, or, not for logical operations(and, or, not).
.Membership and Identity Operators: to test element presence or object identity(in, not in)&(is,is not).
.Bitwise Operators: for bit-level operations.

Conditional Statements: 
.If statements: execute a block if condition is true.
.If-else statements: provide alternative blocks for true or false conditions.
.Nested if statements: if statements inside other if blocks for multiple condition checks.
.Short-hand if statements: concise single-line if statements for simple conditions.
.Else-if Ladder and Multi-Conditional Branching:
The concept of else-if (elif in Python) ladders is for checking multiple conditions sequentially.
Syntax examples use Python-like structure with the if keyword and indentations.
Conditions are evaluated and based on their truth value, corresponding code blocks are executed.

Looping Statements: For and While Loops
.While loops: repeat as long as a condition remains true.
  The while loop syntax is demonstrated as:
  while condition: statements
  The loop continues executing the block until the condition becomes false.
.For loops: iterate over a sequence or range of values.
  The for loop is explained as iterating over a range of numbers or sequence of values.
  Usage of the range() function is demonstrated to generate sequences for looping.
Syntax for both loops is shown, including indentation and colon usage in Python.
