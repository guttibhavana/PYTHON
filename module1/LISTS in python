LIST DATATYPE:
A list is described as a data structure used to store a sequence of various types of data.
Lists can contain heterogeneous data types (i.e., different types of data in one list).
The nature of lists as mutable collections is introduced, meaning their contents can be changed after creation.
Lists are defined using square brackets [ ].

Characteristics and Syntax of Lists:
Items in a list are separated by commas.
Lists can hold multiple values of differing types, such as integers, strings, floats, etc.
Lists are a collection of values or items that can be manipulated.
The mutability of lists is emphasized again, contrasting with immutable data types.
Lists are enclosed within square brackets, distinguishing them syntactically from other data structures.

Indexing in Lists:
Lists have indexes starting at 0 for the first element (zero-based indexing).
The total number of elements in a list is referred to as its length.
Positive indexing begins from the start (left to right), starting at zero.
Negative indexing is introduced as indexing from the end of the list (right to left), starting at -1 for the last element.
Indexing allows accessing individual elements within the list.
The slicing syntax is reiterated: start:stop:skip (skip = step).
Indexing examples with various start, stop, and step parameters are discussed.

The double colon syntax in slicing: ::step.
The step parameter can be used to skip elements or reverse the list (e.g., step = -1 for reversing).
append: Adds a single element to the end of the list.
extend: Adds multiple elements (from an iterable) to the end of the list.

Mutability means lists can grow and shrink dynamically, unlike tuples or strings.
Lists can be modified after creation (add, remove, change elements).	
example:my_list[0] = 10

List Methods: pop(), remove(), and index()
pop(): Removes and returns an element at a specified index (defaults to last).
remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value.
Looping Through Lists and List Comprehensions
Use of for loops to iterate over list elements.

Sets for Uniqueness	Convert list to set to remove duplicates.	
unique = set(my_list)
