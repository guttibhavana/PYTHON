Dictionaries:
Dictionaries are changeable, allowing addition, modification, or deletion of items after creation.
The general concept of a dictionary as a collection of key-value pairs is explained, highlighting its flexibility compared to lists
Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}.
Keys and values can be of various data types, including strings, numbers, and Booleans.
Examples such as {"name": "Sunny", "age": 22} illustrate typical dictionary structure.

common dictionary methods and operations:
clear() to empty the dictionary
copy() to duplicate it
get() to safely retrieve values
items() to get key-value pairs
keys() to get all keys
pop() to remove an item by key
update() to merge dictionaries or update existing keys
Nested dictionaries:
Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values, enabling complex data structures.
Example given:
{ 1: {"name": "Alice"}, 2: {"name": "Bob"} }

Tuple Data structure:
tuples are immutable, contrasting with dictionaries’ mutability.
Immutable ordered sequence, useful for fixed data like coordinates
Python tuples have only two built-in methods: count() and index().
