#INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON

Programming is defined as creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform tasks. This process uses various programming languages like JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and C#.
The video differentiates between programming and coding, emphasizing that programming involves planning and designing software solutions, while coding is writing the actual instructions.
Programming languages are categorized into two types:
High-level languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) which are human-readable.
Low-level languages (e.g., machine code) which consist of binary (zeros and ones) understood directly by computers.
Source code is written in high-level languages and must be translated to machine code for execution.

Python as a Programming Language:
Python is described as an interpreted, high-level, dynamically typed, portable language.
It is free and open source, known for easy-to-read syntax and code readability.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
It has extensive support for graphical user interfaces (GUI) and can be used to build applications such as calculators.
Python’s modularity:
Functions are blocks of code performing specific tasks.
Multiple functions form modules.
Multiple modules form packages.
Collections of packages form libraries.
Python flavors and implementations exist to suit different use cases, though specifics are Not specified.

Applications and Industry Use:
Python is extensively used in multiple domains:
Data science: Due to numerous libraries and frameworks supporting data analysis, machine learning (ML), and deep learning.
Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).
Web development, often alongside JavaScript.
Scientific computing and data visualization.
Major companies using Python include: Google, Dropbox, Yahoo, Uber, Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, IBM.
